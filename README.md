Initially, the scraper must be executed to read and modify the data from the .csv file, preparing it for indexing, analysis, and search functionality. <br>

To run the scraper, use the command python3 scrapper.py in the directory where the Python file is located. <br>

The number of songs to be read is determined by the constant N in the file. <br>

It is important to note that the dataset was sourced from the Kaggle data science community and can be accessed at the following link: [500 Greatest Songs] (https://www.kaggle.com/code/mpwolke/500-greatest-songs). <br>

Next, for file processing, execute the IndexStart. Once it completes, terminate this configuration and run the InformationRetrievalApp, which will open a window with the search engine interface. <br>
